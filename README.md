# Grid CSS for Contao

Add columns to your page layout.

Contao Clickpress Grid uses [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and so less HTML is needed.
Enable the prebuilt CSS Grid in your Contao page layout or generate your own CSS.   

This module is a first working draft
